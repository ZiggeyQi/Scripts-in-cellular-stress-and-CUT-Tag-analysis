This repository containing the core in-house scripts use in the paper "RNAPII degradation by TNF-p38 activated CUL1-FBXO11 E3 ligase benefits cell survival during osmotic stress". These includs analysis for custermized count/depth of defined gene region for CUT&Tag and getting the nascent reads from the TT-TimeLapse sequencing.
